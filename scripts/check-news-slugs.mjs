// Guards the one thing a news post's schema cannot see: two posts claiming one slug.
//
// A post's URL is its `slug` frontmatter, or its file name when it has none. Astro's
// glob loader keys the collection on that, so a collision means one post overwrites the
// other — it drops out of the listing, the feed and the sitemap, and its URL serves the
// other post. The loader logs a warning and the build still succeeds, which on a hosted
// build nobody is watching is the same as no warning at all.
//
// The per-entry schema in site/src/content.config.ts checks the shape of a slug; only
// something that sees every post at once can check they are distinct. That is this.
